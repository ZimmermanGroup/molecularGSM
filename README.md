## Overview
The growing string method is a reaction path and transition state finding method developed in c++.

For more information, check out the wiki page:
https://github.com/ZimmermanGroup/molecularGSM/wiki

Sample tutorial files can be found under the tutorial folder:

Running GSM with the XTB package (from the Grimme lab):

## Installation
This code can be built using CMake. To do so:

1. Load/install CMake
2. Load Intel compilers (if not loaded)
3. Clone this repository and checkout tribits branch

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ZimmermanGroup/molecularGSM.git
$ cd molecularGSM
$ git checkout tribits
```

4. Clone TriBITS repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS.git
```

5. Create a BUILD directory at the same level as GSM
```bash
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
```

6. Configure using CMake
```bash
    $ cmake -D GSM_ENABLE_QCHEM=1 ../
```
    - other options:
        - GSM_ENABLE_QCHEM_SF=1
        - GSM_ENABLE_ORCA=1
        - GSM_ENABLE_GAUSSIAN=1
        - GSM_ENABLE_MOLPRO=1
        - GSM_ENABLE_ASE=1
    - If no option is specified, the code will use MOPAC as its energy calculator. Check mopac.cpp to make sure charge/multiplicity is correct, since that is hard-coded.

7. After successful configuration. To compile:
```bash
    $make -j8
```

8. An executable named "gsm.${CALCULATOR}.exe" will be created in BUILD/GSM directory, where ${CALCULATOR} is the name of the QM package.

To run gsm, copy the executable to the working directory (where the input files are) or reference it using the full path. 

## CTest

There are five test examples: alanine dipeptide isomerization, ammonia borane reactions, diels alder reaction, ethylene rotation, and methanol formaldehyde reaction. After building the executable you can use type $ ctest to run the tests. When each test is complete, the output will be compared with the standard output in each test directory. If the difference in coordinates of a each atom is more than 0.001, the test will fail.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated using Doxygen and hosted on github pages:

https://zimmermangroup.github.io/molecularGSM/

Maintaining this page is not very straightforward and it does not update every time one builds the documentation. Here are some links on how it works:

https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-using-the-command-line/

This is apparently a better solution:

This how the main page can be accessed:

https://pages.github.com/

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TriBITSPub/TriBITS.git
```
